When \"Pattern\" mode is activated the current pattern is continuously repeated. This mode is very well suited to tweak your pattern untill it's just right, since the pattern you are working on is constantly repeated. This way you can immediately hear the changes you have made. In \"Song\" mode the whole song is played. This is useful when putting together the patterns, to create the structure of the song."
